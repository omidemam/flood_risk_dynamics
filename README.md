# Flood Risk Dynamics

This repository contains the codebase for the research paper:

**Large-scale flood risk analysis of culvert infrastructure serving 3000 catchments in New York State**

## Overview

This project investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of flood risk within New York state road networks, focusing on the performance and behavior of large culvert drainage systems. It includes data preprocessing, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, model validation, risk analysis, and visualization workflows used in the study.

## Repository Contents

- `Data preprocessing`: Prepares raw data for parallel computation by cleaning, formatting, and organizing it appropriately.
- `Hydrologic model`: Performs watershed delineation, Curve Number (CN) calculation, and peak hydrologic flow estimation.
- `Hydraulic model`: Calculates the hydraulic capacity of the culverts.
- `Validation`:  Validates each component, including watershed delineation, CN values, peak flow estimations, and hydraulic capacity.
- `Result`: Conducts risk assessment and visualizes both the temporal and spatial dynamics of the risk.
