# CRISIS-aversion (Conditional Risk In Stormwater Infrastructure Systems - aversion)

This repository contains the codebase for the research paper:

**Large-scale flood risk analysis of distributed stormwater infrastructure serving 2,300 catchments in New York State**

## Overview

This project examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood risk within New York State's road networks, with a focus on the performance and behavior of large culvert drainage systems. It includes data preprocessing, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, model validation, risk analysis, and visualization workflows used in the study.

## Repository Contents

- `Data preprocessing`: Prepares raw data for parallel computation by cleaning, formatting, and organizing it appropriately.
- `Hydrologic model`: Performs watershed delineation, Curve Number (CN) calculation, watershed urbanized portion, and peak hydrologic flow estimation.
- `Hydraulic model`: Calculates the hydraulic capacity of the culverts.
- `Validation`:  Validates each component, including watershed delineation, CN values, peak flow estimations, and hydraulic capacity.
- `Result`: Conducts risk assessment and visualizes both the temporal and spatial dynamics of the risk.
