# Flood Risk Dynamics

This repository contains the codebase for the research paper:

**Large-scale flood risk analysis of culvert infrastructure serving 3000 catchments in New York State**

## Overview

This project investigates the spatio-temporal dynamics of flood risk within New York state road networks, focusing on the performance and behavior of large culvert drainage systems. It includes data preprocessing, hydrologic and hydraulic modeling, model validation, risk analysis, and visualization workflows used in the study.
